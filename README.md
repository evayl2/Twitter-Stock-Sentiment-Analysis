# Twitter-Stock-Sentiment-Analysis

We are performing an analysis of tweets to discover relationships between stock prices and their average market sentiment using machine learning techniques : SVM. This project will also show a correlation between prices and their average tweet sentiments (positive, negative, neutral). This project is more focused on finding relationships between sentiment analysis and stock price movements rather than for stock price prediction.
